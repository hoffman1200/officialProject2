# Quarantine's Over Bucket List


We created an application that can be used to write, modify, and delete to do's out of a bucket list. 

## User Story

As a person that has been working from home the past months, I CRAVE making new plans.

Since I WANT to add a little more information on every plan on my list, I need more than just a regular note pad

I WOULD love to share this with my friends so that we can plan some things together.

## Context or "the certainty within the uncertainty"

Most of us have spent the last 4 months working and doing everything from home; without the possibility of planning for the future, the present may feel a little monotonous.
We know that it is not safe to return to our normal lives, but as things are still uncertain 3 out of 3 people (those being the creators of these project) want to start making plans again.

## The Concept

We wanted to create something fun to share with our friends so everyone could start their own when-this-shit-is-over bucketlist. We agreed on some main categories so the users could add and group to-do's on their list. The detailed lists shows up the description, date and place (map included) for each of the activities.

## Technologies Used

* HTML for static pages
* Handlebars for server side templating
* Javacript and jQuery for dynamic
* Bootstrap
* Vanilla CSS

* Postman to ensure GET and POST routes were working
* UsesÂ Node and Express 
* MySQL and Sequelize ORM for database
* Passport for user authentication
* Google Places for maps on each activity

## Future development

Short term
* Aquire domain
* Link with Google Calendar you can see your existing events.
* User authentication for personalized experience.

Mid term
* Have a checkllist to mark the to-do's already done but not having to delete them completely.
* Add images/comments for feedback to each activity once marked as completed.

Long term
* Have all activities on the same map, so user can plan and make routes based on the location of each to-do on the list.
